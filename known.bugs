Known Bugs:
* not handling exponent notation (e.g. 1e-6) ** fixed
* sometimes 0.0 is displayed as -0.0 (might be a rounding issue) ** fixed
* cannot handle more than one sketch at a time (move all sketch related code form TweakMode to TweakEditor) ** fixed
* don't allow tweaking static mode ** fixed

Known Bugs: 01.08.2013 (Gal Sasson)
* run sketch, exit, save changes, then delete lines (duplicate lines apear) ** fixed

Known Bugs: 31.07.2013 (Gal Sasson)
* when stopping a sketch, keep changes window pops up even if there is no change ** fixed

Known Bugs: 30.07.2013 (Gal Sasson)
- Caret is visible in run mode (can be also controlled (might be a feature))
* Error messages that come from compilation contain the wrong line number ** fixed

Known Bugs: 29.07.2013 (Gal Sasson)
* cannot run sketch using the video library: 'library not found' ** fixed

Known Bugs: 28.07.2013 (Gal Sasson)
* negative numbers (e.g. -23) are treated like positive (e.g. 23) ** fixed
* processing: play button should be set off with sketch cannot be run (Mode.handleRun returns null) ** fixed
* missing examples ** fixed

Known Bugs: 27.07.2013 (Gal Sasson)
* when quiting a run, ask/update code. ** done
* limit the mapping of the drag strength in getStrength() ** fixed

Known Bugs: 26.07.2013 (Gal Sasson)
* cannot maintain horizontal scroll when dragging a number point. ** fixed
* user must click 'stop' to go back to edit mode (closing sketch window does not work like 'stop') ** fixed

todo:

- better way to handle float/int detection (currently checking for the existance of '.')
* find better scheme to handle increment/decrement of numbers (slow at the beginning and goes faster later) ** done using normal distribution
* add +/- of how much was incremented. ** done
- add text input for number value
* add space before and after the code. ** done
* add three number modes: integers, floats and floats between -1 - 1. ** done. handling ints and floats differently
- add random number generator that user can attach handle to.
* generate random port number for OSC ** done
* save code when user accept changes ** done
